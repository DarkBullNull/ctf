most of the easy challenges are pretty simple and straight forward

the simplest ones typically involve using strings/hexedit/grep to look for a flag,

also could use netcat to connect to a port and complete some exercise

also could go to an insecure website try and find the flag in the html/css/js
if website tries to ask for input try and use a simple sql inject

the easy buffer overflow ones mostly just require the input to be larger than the buffer

----------------------------------------


* random/general
    look for hidden files by cd into a directory and ls -a to see all files
    try tab auto complete to see if something works and extends

* images jpeg/png
    try and open in text editor
    see if has stenography to hide a key
    steghide
    pngcheck
    binwalk
    foremost

* web exploitation
    Ctrl+u to view source, look through html, css, js
    Ctrl+Shift+i to open developer tools, go to application tab and in the storage section mess with the cookies, set/create an admin from False to True, refresh page
    Ctrl+Shift+i to open developer tools, go to network conditions, uncheck select automatically and change the user agent to be Googlebot or something else
    try an sql inject into text box fields like: ' or 1 = 1;

* binaries
    run strings on the file
    open in hexedit
    for buffer overflow find amount of input needed to overwrite buffer and change the eip
    always check the buffer size, see if there is a gets or a strcpy with no checks

* debugging
    exploit

    want to redirect to system and call it with bin/sh as argument.
    need to find system's location in memory.
    need to find where the string for the shell is stored in environment variables

    in gdb
    print &system
    print $environ


* crypto
    base64
    rot13
    md5
    sha256
    sha512

* cracking
    pdfcrack
    fcrackzip

* linux passwd and shadow file cracking
    This can be done using unshadow on both files and then using John the Ripper on the combined file
    2 basic steps:
    unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt
    john --show passwords.txt

* other simple commands to do
    netcat website port
    grep -r directory
    strings filename | grep pattern
