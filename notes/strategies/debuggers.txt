Hints/Methods for using debuggers on challenges

use Peda for enhanced GDB interface

----------

1.  Uncalled function

    in the binary there is some function(s) which are not called.
    need to find a way to redirect control flow to there.
    since inside a debugger can change register values
    set a breakpoint and stop the program
    redirect execution by overwriting the instruction pointer
    use the address of the function want to call

    info functions
    print &func_name
    set $rip = func_addr
    continue


2.  Open and read data from a protected file

    cant open a password file that is read protected
    the program does and then reads that data into a buffer
    set a breakpoint and stop the program after the read finishes
    now the data will be in memory so can print the contents of the variable

    print (char*) &password
