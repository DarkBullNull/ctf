 More generally there's only one rule: don't patch!
 Unless the author explicitely said that patching is a valid solution, don't do it.
 Write your keygen, write your solution.

specifically search for "patch" to find patchmes

each folder with a challenge should have a writeup
K - if it is a keygen style problem a keygen script should be there
P - if it is a patching style problem a patched executable should be there
