Google Chromesâ€™ User Data information can be located in the AppData directory.

Chrome uses the Win32 API, which contains two functions for handling password encryption and decryption: CryptProtectData and CryptUnprotectData.
Mimikatz takes advantage of the CryptUnprotectData API function and displays all credentials used on websites visited in plaintext.

The following command will go through all the entries within the file you have provided and extract the plaintext passwords.

dpapi::chrome /unprotect /in:"[FILE PATH HERE]"
