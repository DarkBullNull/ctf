picoCTF 2018 challenges

2018 Shell Server Consolidation
Problem Status Notice:
As part of the groundwork for the upcoming 2019 competition, we are re-organizing our infrastructure of past competition servers.
The 2018shell1 through 2018shell4 servers have been consolidated to a single 2018shell.picoctf.com host.

As a result, a small number of problems have been re-assigned to different ports, and a few problems have newly randomized flags.
Please see the Piazza problem status post for details, and double-check your problem descriptions for any n that list.
