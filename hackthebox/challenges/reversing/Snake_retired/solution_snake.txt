----------------------------------------

PART1: user name

aa = '\x61'
db = '\x6e'
nn = '\x61'
ef = '\x63'
rr = '\x6f'
gh = '\x6e'
lr = '\x64'
ty = '\x61'

slither = aa + db + nn + ef + rr + gh + lr + ty

if user_input == slither:
    pass

name = "anaconda"

----------------------------------------

PART2: password

note: auth[] and password[] are not used

tells you the magic number when run

calculate by formula

lock_pick = random.randint(0, 0x3e8)
lock = lock_pick * 2
lock = lock + 10
lock = lock / 2
lock = lock - lock_pick

calculate out and the lock is always 5 every time

lock = 5

keys = [ 0x70, 0x61, 0x73, 0x73, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x64, 0x21, 0x21 ]

keys = "password!!"

chains = [0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x69, 0x73, 0x20, 0x61, 0x20, 0x74, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x6c]

chains = "this is a troll"

chars = []

for key in keys:
    keys_encrypt = lock ^ key
    chars.append(keys_encrypt)

chars = [u,d,v,v,r,j,w,a,$,$]

for chain in chains:
    chains_encrypt = chain + 0xA
    chars.append(chains_encrypt)

chars = [u,d,v,v,r,j,w,a,$,$,~,r,s,},*,s,},*,k,*,~,|,y,v,v]

password = "udvvrjwa$$~rs}*s}*k*~|yvv"

----------------------------------------

Enter your username
anaconda
Enter your password
udvvrjwa$$~rs}*s}*k*~|yvv
Good Job

----------------------------------------

keys is the password and chains is just random trash added to the end
it will print Good Job since the first part is correct then it breaks out.

actually
username: anaconda
password: udvvrjwa$$
