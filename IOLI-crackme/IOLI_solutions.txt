IOLI_Crackme

Only the Linux elf binaries
The goal is not only just to extract the password,
but to patch the files so that they always say "Password OK :)"

Completed:
    * crackme0x00
    * crackme0x01
    * crackme0x02
    * crackme0x03
    * crackme0x04
    * crackme0x05
    * crackme0x06
    * crackme0x07
    * crackme0x08
    * crackme0x09

Note1:
    some of the crackmes have multiple keys that work:
        * crackme0x04 == sum of digits is 15
        * crackme0x05 - crackme0x09 == sum of digits is 16, and sum of digits is even

Note2:
    I solved crackme0x05 in an unusual way.
    The check needs strings where:
        * the integer representation of the string is even
        * the sum of the characters in the string is 16
    I based my solution on crackme0x04 where I added '1' fifteen times.
    I saw a similar structure to the crackme0x004 and used that knowledge
    I didn't think of trying to use other strings which add to 16
    I also didn't realize the AND EAX, 1; TEST EAX, EAX was a check if divisible by 2 for evens
    That is why i did format sting attacks targeting the sscanf
    It stops on a null byte early when it writes to the string buffer

    my key: 0\01111111111111111
