Password: 5274

----------------------------------------

this can be found by loading it into a disassembler and looking at main
at line 0x0804842b the input from scanf is compared to 0x149a which is 5274 in decimal
the password must be entered in decimal format or it will not work.

|           0x08048426      e8e1feffff     call sym.imp.scanf          ; int scanf(const char *format)
|           0x0804842b      817dfc9a1400.  cmp dword [var_4h], 0x149a
|       ,=< 0x08048432      740e           je 0x8048442

inside of main at address 0x08048432 there is the "je 0x8048442" after the "cmp dword [local_4h], 0x149a"
the input from scanf is compared against this value before the jump, if they are equal then it succeeds
this is the part which jumps to the printing password ok message if the input was correct.
changing this to an unconditional jump instruction "jmp 0x8048442" will change the executable to always print password ok.
