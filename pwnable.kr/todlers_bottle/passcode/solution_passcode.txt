Mommy told me to make a passcode based login system.
My initial C code was compiled without any error!
Well, there was some compiler warning, but who cares about that?

ssh passcode@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)

----------------------------------------

when compiled the program has 2 errors with pointers in the scanf function calls

passcode.c: In function ‘login’:
passcode.c:9:8: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]
  scanf("%d", passcode1);
        ^
passcode.c:14:15: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]
         scanf("%d", passcode2);
               ^

also passcodes is uninitialized when used...



after entering a username
need to enter passcode1

if enter a number it will segfault
if enter a char then will fail
